Notes/Direction to designer


Color Schemes to use in website - they match with new web app
====================
Primary Colors
grey - 95/94/93 - 5F5E5D
Red - 226/74/55
Secondary
grey - 180/113/98
Red 232/113/98 #E87162

Design and implementation approach
==================
I think it will be easier to work on the images in advance and slot them in to 
this prototype site.

The prototype site you have been delivered has all the copy that will be going 
into the final site

Deployment
============
This site is going to interface with a Django back end via an api and is going to serve as
the starting point for clients to create an instance of r/ally for their organization

Site Map
===========
home page
 - thanksforsigningup
 - confirmemail.html - once multitenancy is active
 - signup.html
 - team.html
  - the user would then end up loggedin to the responsive web version of the application

Images
=========
In the mock up there are many images that are serving as place holders that need
to be improved
Any images that we need developed





Fonts
=============
style the fonts with the same font as the data sheet


site map
========

nav bar
===========
center the logo in the white space - too far over to the left margin

Home/Prom Sections
==========
select image for the background - want something that captures relaxtion/work/knowledge
Font does not need to be white
Forms
Eventually this form is going to be the start of how users create their own version of our application
Until that is ready we are going to a simple register in advance

Imagine
====
Stylize this text

why rally
======
Learn more - link to modal pop up with data sheet?

How it works
==========
Want to give users an overview of how r/ally combines data from different sources
and combines it
- this needs to be stylized and some detail needs to be removed - it might be easier to work on the image in advance





Features
=============
Center the elements on the page
